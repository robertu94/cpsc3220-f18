FAT (32) file systems

Max Blocks: 2^28 blocks
Max File Size: 2^32 -1 bytes

Index Structure:
	+ 1 block metadata
	+	2 FAT tables, 8 blocks each
	+ Root directory after that
	+	directory can contain upto 16 entries
	+ entry number corresponds cluster number
	+	entry in table is address of next FAT entry or 0

Free Space Tracking:
	+ look for zero entry in FAT

Locality Heuristics:
	+	Use next fit algorithm where possible
	+	problem of defragmentation

Problems:
	+	poor locality on physical disk
	+	poor random access
	+	limited (and fixed) metadata
	+ no support for hard links
	+ no transactional update
